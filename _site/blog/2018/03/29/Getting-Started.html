<h2 id="road-to-jekyll">Road to Jekyll</h2>

<p>So, as I came to the decision of making blogs, now the question was how the hell do I make a blog and wondering about it bought a thought to my mind my mind why not just use Github pages to host the site.</p>

<p>I was introduced to Github pages during my college days. Then I had no clue that Github could be used to host static pages. One of my classmates showed me that such a marvel is possible. Idea was soo simple and truly amazing.</p>

<p>To host in Github.io i first had to get clear with the idea for that i started looking into https://guides.github.com/features/pages/. So now the next step was to put up a site where i could post with ease. One of my collegues here had already made me aware of Jekyll which provides the ease of posting which i was searching for and here I am posting my first post.</p>

<h2 id="setting-up-jekyll">Setting Up Jekyll</h2>

<p><strong>System Specs</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>OS:    Ubuntu 16.04 LTS</li>
  <li>RAM: 8GB</li>
</ul>

<p>As jekyll needs ruby which i didnâ€™t have in the system I began the steps for the installation from there</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">  <span class="nb">sudo </span>apt-get <span class="nb">install </span>ruby-full
  gem <span class="nb">install </span>jekyll
  jekyll new my-blog
  <span class="c"># Produced warning Could not load Bundler. Bundle install skipped.</span>
  <span class="c"># Then i realized we need something called bundler which i installed with the below commands</span>
  bundle <span class="nb">exec </span>jekyll serve
  gem <span class="nb">install </span>bundler
  <span class="nb">rm</span> <span class="nt">-rf</span> my-blog
  jekyll new my-blog
  <span class="c"># That created the blog</span></code></pre></figure>
