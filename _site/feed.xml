&lt;h2 id=&quot;road-to-jekyll&quot;&gt;Road to Jekyll&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So i come to the decision of making blogs, now the question is how the hell i make a blog? I have literally no clue as to where would i make a blog or how to host it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my college days i have come across this amazing way to host static sites in gihub.io. So here i am having confusions on how to host a blog and i just had a thought why not use github.io to host the blog.
For this first i have brush up on Github.io which i did from the site https://guides.github.com/features/pages/ and there it was Jekyll which would produce basic template for the blog and sounded cool and here i am posting my first post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;setting-up-jekyll&quot;&gt;Setting Up Jekyll&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;System Specs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;OS:    Ubuntu 16.04 LTS&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;RAM: 8GB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As jekyll needs ruby which i didnâ€™t have in the system i began the steps for the installation from there&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;apt-get &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;install &lt;/span&gt;ruby-full
  gem &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;install &lt;/span&gt;jekyll
  jekyll new my-blog
  &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Produced warning Could not load Bundler. Bundle install skipped.&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Then i realized we need something called bundler which i installed with the below commands&lt;/span&gt;
  bundle &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;exec &lt;/span&gt;jekyll serve
  gem &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;install &lt;/span&gt;bundler
  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;rm&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-rf&lt;/span&gt; my-blog
  jekyll new my-blog
  &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# That created the blog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Over the years i had experimented with a lot of technologies which was never documented anywhere nor shared anywhere.
