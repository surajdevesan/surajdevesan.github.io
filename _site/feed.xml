&lt;h2 id=&quot;road-to-jekyll&quot;&gt;Road to Jekyll&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, as I came to the decision of making blogs, now the question was how the hell do I make a blog and wondering about it bought a thought to my mind why not just use Github pages to host the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was introduced to Github pages during my college days. Then I had no clue that Github could be used to host static pages. One of my classmates showed me that such a marvel is possible. Idea was soo simple and truly amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To host in Github.io I first had to get clear with the idea for that I started looking into https://guides.github.com/features/pages/. So now the next step was to put up a site where I could post with ease. One of my collegues here had already made me aware of Jekyll which provides the ease of posting which I was searching for and here I am posting my first post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;setting-up-jekyll&quot;&gt;Setting Up Jekyll&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;System Specs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;OS:    Ubuntu 16.04 LTS&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;RAM: 8GB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As jekyll needs ruby which I didnâ€™t have in the system I began the steps for the installation from there&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;apt-get install ruby-full
  gem install jekyll
  jekyll new my-blog
  &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Produced warning Could not load Bundler. Bundle install skipped.&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Then I realized we need something called bundler which I installed with the below commands&lt;/span&gt;
  bundle &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;exec &lt;/span&gt;jekyll serve
  gem install bundler
  rm &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-rf&lt;/span&gt; my-blog
  jekyll new my-blog
  &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# That created the blog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Over the years I had experimented with a lot of technologies which were never documented anywhere nor shared anywhere.
